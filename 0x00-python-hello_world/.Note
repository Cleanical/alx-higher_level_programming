For the current code for 1-run_inline:
#!/bin/bash
echo $PYCODE | python3

meaning that the content of PYCODE should be echoed or written out and run with(|) python3. And we have already exported PYCODE as such: 
export PYCODE='print(f"Best School: {88+10}")'

meaning the content of PYCODE is now equated to that 'prin...
ANOTHER METHOD is to create a folder to export PYCODE to. Example can be testmain. May or not have .py extension. cat testmain:
#!/bin/usr/python3
print(f"Best School: {88+10}")

then have the excutable file, test. It contains the shell script to run python code. Cat test:
#!/bin/bash
python3 $PYCODE

$PYCODE is known as the environment variable in which the python code is saved.
